# AndroidCamera

Just a try to get a solid implementation of android.hardware.Camera.

Already done:
- All supported Flash Modes
- All supported Focus Modes
- Asynchronous Frame processing (via AsyncTasks)
- Correct alignment in any orientation

Missing:
- Switch between different supported resolutions (based on relevant aspect ratio)
